# Team-Profile-Generator  

## Description

My motivation was to practice the knowlege I've got on NodeJS Module, and applying Node Package Manager.
My aim was to create a command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.
During this project I learned how to work with classes and create a unit test.
